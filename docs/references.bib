    Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression
    data. It includes methods for preprocessing, visualization, clustering,
    pseudotime and trajectory inference, differential expression testing, and
    simulation of gene regulatory networks. Its Python-based implementation
    efficiently deals with data sets of more than one million cells
    (https://github.com/theislab/Scanpy). Along with Scanpy, we present
    AnnData, a generic class for handling annotated data matrices
    (https://github.com/theislab/anndata).

    Deliberative and participatory approaches to democracy seek to directly
    include citizens in decision-making and agenda-setting processes. These
    methods date back to the very foundations of democracy in Athens, where
    regular citizens shared the burden of governance and deliberated every
    major issue. However, thinkers at the time rightly believed that these
    methods could not function beyond the scale of the city-state, or
    &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;polis&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. Representative democracy as an
    innovation improved on the scalability of collective decision making, but
    in doing so, sacrificed the extent to which regular citizens could
    participate in deliberation. Modern technology, including advances in
    computational power, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization
    techniques, presents a unique opportunity to scale out deliberative
    processes. Here we describe Polis, an open source web application capable
    of collecting and synthesizing feedback from people in a scalable and
    distributed fashion. Polis has shown itself capable of building shared
    understanding, disincentivizing counterproductive behavior (trolling), and
    cultivating points of consensus. It has done this in the context of
    journalistic and academic research, and directly as part of decision-making
    bodies at local and national levels, directly affecting legislation. These
    results demonstrate that deliberative processes can be scaled up beyond the
    constraints of in-person gatherings and small groups.
