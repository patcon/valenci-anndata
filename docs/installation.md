# Installation

For now, installation is a bit inelegant:

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/patcon/valency-anndata
```

Once we make a full release and settle the versions of our dependant libraries, installation will be simply `pip install valency-anndata`!

At the moment, there are a lot of core dependencies (even without installing development packages). In the future, we will have a more slim core if there is interest.
